Designing a Public Health Service Application

Introduction:
The growing emphasis on health and nutrition has prompted "Sant√© publique France" to seek innovative applications in this domain. In response, our project aims to contribute by proposing a data-driven application focused on nutrition.

Project Overview:
Our application will leverage the extensive Open Food Facts dataset to address key aspects of nutrition. The primary goal is to empower users with valuable insights into the nutritional content of food products, fostering informed and healthier choices.

Key Steps:

Data Exploration and Cleaning:
Brainstorming for an application idea that aligns with public health goals.
Identifying relevant variables in the Open Food Facts dataset.
Conducting thorough data cleaning, addressing missing values using advanced methods and identifying outliers in each variable.
Automation of Processes:
Developing automated procedures to streamline data processing and analysis, ensuring efficiency and consistency.
Univariate Analysis:
Performing in-depth analysis for each significant variable, generating insights into their individual behaviors.
Visualization:
Creating visualizations throughout the analysis to enhance understanding and interpretation of the data.
Multivariate Analysis:
Employing multivariate analysis techniques to confirm or refute hypotheses derived from the univariate analysis.
Conducting appropriate statistical tests to validate the significance of the results.
Application Justification:
Justifying the chosen application concept based on the insights and patterns uncovered in the data.
Identifying arguments supporting the feasibility of the application in addressing public health concerns.
Project Documentation and Presentation:
Compiling a comprehensive exploration report detailing the methodologies, findings, and insights.
Preparing a compelling pitch to effectively communicate the application concept and its potential impact during the project presentation.
By undertaking this project, we aim to contribute to the promotion of public health through a user-friendly and data-driven nutrition application.
